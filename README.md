My pure Python 3.x implementation of [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/). Requires NumPy for matrix operations; otherwise, has no dependencies.
  
To run any of the demo programs, clone/download the repo and execute the following command from the python folder:  
  
`python ch<#>_program`  
  
where <#> is the relevant chapter number. This will produce an image file named **canvas.ppm** (NOTE: you might need to use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or another image editing program to convert the PPM file to an image format your system can display).
